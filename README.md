# One Piece Module for Particle Tracking

This piece of art is a particle tracking model designed to track colloidal particles in complex porous media on the micro scale. This model is capable to capture the attached colloids on the medium grain surfaces under favorable and unfavorable conditions. Furthermore, it can calculate several quantities such as:

1. Attachment location (Retention Profile)
2. Bulk Residence Time
3. Near Surface Residence Time (the time that the colloid spent inside the near surface zone (200 nm from the grain surface) of the grain that this colloid attached on).
4. The number of grains that a colloid interacted with prior attachment.
5. Breakthrough Curve
6. attachment angle (relative to the front flow stagnation zone of the corresponding grain)
